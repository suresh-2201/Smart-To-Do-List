## 🚀 Why I Built This<br>

As a self-driven learner transitioning into full-stack web development, I wanted to build a project that:<br>

- Uses **real-world logic and UI elements**<br>
- Applies **core JavaScript and DOM** concepts<br>
- Solves an actual productivity problem<br>
- Looks polished enough for **recruiters and freelance clients**<br>

This project reflects everything I’ve learned so far and pushes me to write clean, modular, reusable frontend code.<br>

✅ Building **responsive layouts** with Bootstrap  <br>
✅ Writing modular, maintainable code with clean folder structure  <br>
